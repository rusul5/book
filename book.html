                            development. It involves studies of the human condition with its
                            core being the capability approach. The inequality adjusted Human
                            Development Index is used as a way of measuring actual progress in
                            human development by the United Nations. It is an alternative approach
                            to a single focus on economic growth, and focused more on social justice,
                            as a way of understanding progress.
